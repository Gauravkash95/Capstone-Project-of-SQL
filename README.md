# Capstone-Project-of-SQL
📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive SQL Capstone focused on querying and analyzing an Airline Database (Airline DB). It involves writing SQL queries to extract meaningful insights, optimize airline operations, and generate reports on flights, passengers, bookings, and aircraft details.

📂 Dataset & Environment
The queries are executed on Airline DB, which contains multiple interrelated tables such as:

Bookings
Tickets
Boarding Passes
Flights
Aircrafts
Airports
🔍 Key SQL Queries & Use Cases
The project covers a wide range of SQL concepts and real-world airline data analysis tasks, including:

Data Formatting & Aggregation

Convert booking dates into "YYYY-MMM-DD" format.
Find month-wise highest & lowest paying passengers.
Flight & Passenger Insights

Identify passengers with non-stop or return journeys.
Find the total number of tickets without boarding passes.
Flight Schedule & Operational Analysis

Identify the longest flight duration.
List all morning flights (6 AM to 11 AM).
Find the earliest morning flight from each airport.
Airport & Aircraft Analysis

List all airports in the Europe/Moscow time zone.
Count seats per aircraft in various fare conditions.
Identify aircrafts with Business Class seats.
Performance & Cancellation Reports

Find airports with the most and least scheduled departures.
Count flights without actual departures from DME airport.
Identify flights using Airbus or Boeing aircraft that got canceled or delayed.
Financial & Refund Analysis

Identify customers eligible for refunds due to flight cancellations.
Compute total refunds per passenger.
💡 SQL Techniques Used
